    <h2>How the Bishop Consecration Network Was Built</h2>

  <p>This network visualizes relationships between Catholic bishops based on consecrations.</p>
  <p>I scraped data from <a href="https://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/">Catholic-Hierarchy.org</a>, collecting information on thousands of living bishops worldwide.</p>
  <p>Each bishop page was processed to extract who consecrated whom, including principal consecrators and co-consecrators.</p>
  <p>A directed network was created where nodes represent bishops and edges represent consecrations.</p>
  <p>In addition, bishops who were the (co-)consecrators of the same bishop were connected, forming a second type of link based on common lineage.</p>
  <p>All links and nodes were filtered to ensure only <a href="https://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/ll.html" target="_blank">living bishops</a> were included.</p>
  <p>Degree, betweenness, closeness, and PageRank indicators were calculated for each bishop to assess influence within the global hierarchy.</p>
  <p>Labels (bishop names) and extra metadata like Wikidata IDs were added to enrich the visualization.</p>
  <p>To focus the display, I kept only the largest connected group of bishops and filtered out those with very few connections for the global network (less then four).</p>
  <p>The resulting graph offers insights into how Catholic leadership is interconnected across countries and generations.</p>

  <h3>Example</h3>
  <p>If Bishop A consecrated Bishop B, an arrow is drawn from A to B.<br>
     If Bishop C and Bishop D were both (co-)consecrators of the same bishop, they are also connected by a shared consecration link.</p>

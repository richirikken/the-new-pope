  <h2>Construction of Network Indicators</h2>
  <p>This section describes the indicators used to analyze the cardinal networks during the 2025 Conclave.</p>

  <h3>Conclave 2025 Network Indicators</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Number of ties</strong> – The number of direct consecration links to or from a cardinal within the conclave network.</li>
    <li><strong>Betweenness</strong> – Measures how often a cardinal appears on the shortest paths between other cardinals.</li>
    <li><strong>PageRank</strong> – Evaluates the overall influence of a cardinal based on connections with influential others.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>All Bishops Network Indicators</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Number of ties</strong> – Total consecration links in the global bishops network.</li>
    <li><strong>Betweenness</strong> – Cardinal's strategic importance across the entire worldwide bishop network.</li>
    <li><strong>PageRank</strong> – Influence measurement across the full episcopal hierarchy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Other Indicators</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Betting probability</strong> – The cardinal's chance of election derived from public betting markets.

   <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Network centrality</strong> measures such as number of ties, betweenness, and pagerank are all <strong>highly interrelated</strong>. This is expected in a tightly connected network.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Betting probability</strong> and <strong>reputation</strong> are moderately tied to centrality. More central actors are perceived as more reputable and are more frequently bet on.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Pagerank among all bishops</strong> and <strong>number of ties among all bishops</strong> are <strong>almost interchangeable</strong>. Their strong correlation suggests they capture very similar network roles.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Interpretation</h2>
    <p>
        Actors who have more connections tend to occupy central positions as brokers in the network (high betweenness). Those central figures also tend to have higher reputation and are bet on more often.
    </p>

    <p>
        While most centrality measures overlap strongly, Pagerank captures slightly different aspects compared to simple tie counts or betweenness, showing moderate rather than very high correlations with others.

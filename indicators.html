<h2>Difficulty of Prediction</h2>

<p><em>"Chi entra papa in conclave ne esce cardinale."</em> — This Italian proverb ("He who enters the conclave as pope exits as cardinal") reflects the historical unpredictability of papal elections. Early favorites often fail to secure the papacy.</p>

<p>For example, during the 2013 conclave, bookmakers did not list Jorge Mario Bergoglio (later Pope Francis) among the top six most likely candidates (<em>O'Connell, 2019</em>). His election was seen as a surprise to many external commentators.</p>

<p>However, retrospective social network analyses suggest a different story. Five years after his election, an exploratory analysis of episcopal consecration networks showed Bergoglio occupying a strong hidden position in the global Catholic network — probably already before his papal election (even though historic reconstructions remain difficult).</p>

<p>Social network theory emphasizes that "actors who are better connected or occupy more strategic positions often have access to greater resources, information, and influence" (<em>Borgatti & Everett, 2006</em>). Thus, internal network dynamics may decisively influence leadership selection.</p>

<h2>Construction of Network Indicators</h2>
<p>This section describes the indicators used to analyze the cardinal networks during the 2025 Conclave.</p>

<h3>Conclave 2025 Network Indicators</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Number of ties</strong> – The number of direct consecration links to or from a cardinal within the conclave network.</li>
  <li><strong>Betweenness</strong> – How often a cardinal appears on the shortest paths between other cardinals.</li>
  <li><strong>PageRank</strong> – Influence based on connections with other influential cardinals.</li>
</ul>

<h3>All Bishops Network Indicators</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Number of ties</strong> – Total consecration links in the global bishops network.</li>
  <li><strong>Betweenness</strong> – Cardinal's strategic position across the worldwide episcopal network.</li>
  <li><strong>PageRank</strong> – Influence within the broader global Catholic hierarchy.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Indicators</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Betting probability</strong> – Chance of election derived from public betting markets, sourced from 
    <a href="https://www.oddschecker.com/insight/specials/20250421-next-pope-odds-who-is-favourite-to-succeed-francis" target="_blank">OddsChecker (April 29, 2025)</a>.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Reputation</strong> – Number of awards received according to Wikidata entries.</li>
  <li><strong>Expert opinion</strong> – Number of expert mentions across major media sources:
    <a href="https://www.detroitcatholic.com" target="_blank">Detroit Catholic</a>,
    <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk" target="_blank">The Independent</a>,
    <a href="https://abcnews.go.com" target="_blank">ABC News</a>,
    <a href="https://www.wired.it" target="_blank">Wired Italy</a>,
    <a href="https://www.ilgiornale.it" target="_blank">Il Giornale</a>,
    <a href="https://www.bbc.com" target="_blank">BBC News</a>,
    <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com" target="_blank">CBS News</a>,
    and
    <a href="https://www.domradio.de" target="_blank">Domradio</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Correlation Matrix</h3>

<iframe title="Correlation Matrix" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-vunJ3" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vunJ3/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="992" height="489" data-external="1"></iframe>

<h3>Key Findings</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Network centrality</strong> measures like ties, betweenness, and PageRank are highly interrelated. This reflects a tightly connected conclave network.</li>
  <li><strong>Betting probability</strong> and <strong>reputation</strong> moderately correlate with centrality, suggesting that more central figures enjoy greater visibility and expectations.</li>
  <li><strong>Pagerank among all bishops</strong> and <strong>number of ties among all bishops</strong> are nearly interchangeable in capturing global influence.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interpretation</h2>

<p>Cardinals with more connections occupy more central network positions, which leads to higher reputation and perceived electability.</p>

<p>While most network measures overlap strongly, Pagerank captures slightly distinct aspects of influence compared to simple tie counts or betweenness.</p>

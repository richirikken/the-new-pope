    “Conclaves are shaped long before the doors of the Sistine Chapel are closed, by networks of friendships, alliances, and shared visions.”<br>
    <span style="display: block; margin-top: 10px; font-weight: bold;">&mdash; Austin Ivereigh, <em>The Great Reformer</em> (2014)</span>
  </div>

  <h2>Difficulties of Prediction</h2>
  <p><em>"Chi entra papa in conclave ne esce cardinale."</em> &mdash; This Italian proverb ("He who enters the conclave as pope exits as cardinal") highlights the historical unpredictability of papal elections.</p>
  <p>
    For example, bookmakers did not list Jorge Mario Bergoglio (Pope Francis) among the top six candidates before his 2013 election (<em>O'Connell, 2019</em>).
    However, social network analysis reveals that hidden forms of influence, such as episcopal consecration networks, may offer deeper insight into real power structures.
  </p>
  <p>
    Historical betting data shows that in the past ten conclaves, the betting favorite won only three times. On as many occasions, cardinals with minimal or zero betting odds became pope (<em>Williams & Paton, 2015</em>).
    Despite the growth of prediction markets, conclave outcomes remain extremely uncertain.
  </p>

  <h2>Construction of Network Indicators</h2>

  <h3>Conclave 2025 Network Indicators</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Number of ties</strong> &mdash; Number of direct consecration links to or from a cardinal.</li>
    <li><strong>Betweenness</strong> &mdash; Frequency of appearing on shortest paths connecting other cardinals.</li>
    <li><strong>PageRank</strong> &mdash; Influence score reflecting the connectedness to other influential figures.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>All Bishops Network Indicators</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Number of ties</strong> &mdash; Total consecration links globally among bishops.</li>
    <li><strong>Betweenness</strong> &mdash; Strategic bridging position within the global Catholic network.</li>
    <li><strong>PageRank</strong> &mdash; Hierarchical influence across the worldwide episcopacy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Other Indicators</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Betting probability</strong> &mdash; Cardinal's chance of election based on aggregated betting markets.

    </li>
    <li><strong>Reputation</strong> &mdash; Number of awards received, according to Wikidata profiles.</li>
    <li><strong>Expert opinion</strong> &mdash; Number of times cited as papabile across major media sources:

<h3>Correlation Matrix</h3>

<iframe title="Correlation Matrix" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-vunJ3" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vunJ3/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="992" height="489" data-external="1"></iframe>

<h3>Key Findings</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Network centrality</strong> measures like ties, betweenness, and PageRank are highly interrelated. This reflects a tightly connected conclave network.</li>
  <li><strong>Betting probability</strong> and <strong>reputation</strong> moderately correlate with centrality, suggesting that more central figures enjoy greater visibility and expectations.</li>
  <li><strong>Pagerank among all bishops</strong> and <strong>number of ties among all bishops</strong> are nearly interchangeable in capturing global influence.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interpretation</h2>

<p>Cardinals with more connections occupy more central network positions, which leads to higher reputation and perceived electability.</p>

<p>While most network measures overlap strongly, Pagerank captures slightly distinct aspects of influence compared to simple tie counts or betweenness.</p>
  
  <h2>Betting Odds Aggregation Methodology</h2>
  <p>
    Betting odds are sourced from <strong>Polymarket</strong>, <strong>Smarkets</strong>, and <strong>Kalshi</strong>. Every day, the previous day's odds (captured at 11:59 PM) are recorded. To produce a weighted average:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Each market is weighted according to the logarithm of its market capitalization.</li>
    <li>Missing odds are treated as zero if a cardinal is not listed on a platform.</li>
    <li>The resulting averages are rescaled to sum exactly to 100%.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This method aims to reflect both breadth (all available candidates) and market strength (size of participation).
